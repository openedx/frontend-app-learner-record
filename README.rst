Purpose
*******

The Learner Record provides information about the enrolled programs for a user.
It contains views for a learners current status in a program, their current grade, and the ability to share any earned credentials either publically or with institutions.

Verifiable Credentials
======================

Optionally, this micro-frontend allows `verifiable credentials`_ creation for already achieved Open edX credentials (currently, program certificates only).

This is the Learner Record micro-frontend, currently under development by `edX <https://www.edx.org>`_.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository via SSH
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/frontend-app-learner-record.git

  # Enter the directory
    cd frontend-app-learner-record

  # Clean Install dependencies
    npm ci

  # Start the Learner Record MFE
    npm start

The page will then be hosted on http://localhost:1990/

Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Grab the latest code
    git fetch
    git pull

  # Make a new branch for your changes
    git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Clean install/update the dev requirements
    npm ci

  # Start the Learner Record MFE
    npm start

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
    vim ...

  # Run the tests after making changes (to verify the status before you make any changes)
    npm test

  # Commit all your changes
    git commit ...
    git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review after the github CI has passed.

Environment Variables/Setup Notes
---------------------------------

Currently, this MFE is not intergrated into the devstack, and must be run locally. This MFE requires credentials to be running, and will use a REST API from the Credentials IDA located at `credentials/apps/records/rest_api`.

Credentials uses 2 enviroment variables to link to this MFE:

* ``USE_LEARNER_RECORD_MFE`` -- Toggles the navigation in credentials to redirect to this MFE
* ``LEARNER_RECORD_MFE_RECORDS_PAGE_URL`` -- The URL for the base URL of this MFE

More details for these flags can be found in the base configuration of credentials: ``credentials/settings/base``
This MFE has 2 flags of its own:

* ``SUPPORT_URL_LEARNER_RECORDS`` -- A link to a help/support center for learners who run into problems whilst trying to share their records
* ``USE_LR_MFE`` -- A toggle that when on, uses the MFE to host shared records instead of the the old UI inside of credentials

Verifiable Credentials
......................

An optional feature. It is behind a feature flag.
The feature introduces two environment variables:

* ``ENABLE_VERIFIABLE_CREDENTIALS`` -- Toggles the Verifiable Credentials feature (used by the Credentials IDA and this micro-frontend)
* ``SUPPORT_URL_VERIFIABLE_CREDENTIALS`` -- A link to a help/support center for learners who run into problems while trying to create their verifiable credential

The Verifiable Credentials UI is a functional addition to the corresponding backend app. It will use a REST API from the Credentials IDA located at `credentials/apps/verifiable_credentials/rest_api`.
